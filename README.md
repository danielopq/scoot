## My process

I built the website following a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal performance and usability on smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices.

The development process was structured component by component, creating modular, reusable elements that could be adapted efficiently. Each component was designed with responsiveness in mind, using CSS Flexbox and Grid, as well as media queries, to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

To maintain consistency and improve maintainability, I followed a scalable design system, incorporating variables for colors, typography, and spacing.

Accessibility was another priority, ensuring proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for a more inclusive user experience.
